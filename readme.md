# Waso: A Node/React/Webpack Catalog

A Node/React build that renders a JSON file into a simple catalog.  Limited support for tablet/mobile displays.

## TODO:
- Make scalable for any kind of JSON
- Add CORS support
- Add support for carousel (app pulls image files but does not render)
- Add social media features (additional components TBD)
- Additional support for node customization (ports, etc.)
- Additional css modification / beautification
- Additional actions on click
- Fix bug found in json-loader

## Installation:
1. `git clone https://github.com/raydot/Waso.git`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run start`
4. point browser to `http://localhost:3001/` (modify webpack.config.js to change)
